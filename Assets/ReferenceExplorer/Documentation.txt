Hi!
Thanks for downloading Reference Explorer package. I'm really happy to show you the features of this awesome editor tool!

First things first!
Reference Explorer is an editor tool that helps you find references and dependencies between objects. 

Why this is useful? 
This way you will know even better your project. When a project grows hundreds of objects are created and perhaps nobody is using them, or 
there are so many that you don't know which object is using them. Well this tool will help you.

How to use it?
You have two ways:

Go to Window->Reference Explorer and you will find several options or you can right click in your project and select Reference Explorer and
you will see the same options.

The features are:

References Explorer:
This option will allow you to drag and drop an object from your project and find every object that is using it.
Also will search possible usability in scripts via Resources.Load or AssetDatabase but please be aware that it is not 100% sure.

Dependencies Explorer:
This options will allow you to drag and drop an object from your project and find every object that the selected object is using.

Ophan References Explorer:
This option will find every object that is not referenced to any other object.
Objects that part of their path is being used in a script will be a warning icon indicating that that object was found in a script.

Atlas Prefab Reference Explorer:
This option will allow you to drag and drop a .spriteatlas file and search every prefab that is using some sprite of that atlas.
